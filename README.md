# ClickNClear Coding Test API & Web App

### How do I run it?

Before doing anything, run `npm i` to install the necessary node modules. After this, the API can be started by running `npm start`.

The web application can be opened using either the `index.html` file in `testing-api/build`, or by clicking the shortcut in the root `clicknclear-test` folder.

While the build version of the React app should run fine, I've also included the development version for clarity.
